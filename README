The purpose of Blossom is to get you up and running as quickly as
possible with Haml, Sass and Compass:

  $ gem install blossom
  $ blossom foo
  $ cd foo
  $ rackup
  $ open http://localhost:9292/
  $ emacs foo.haml foo.sass

Blossom automatically makes a Git repository for the project and
creates a first commit containing the initial boilerplate.

You could actually push this to Heroku right away:

  $ heroku create foo
  $ git push heroku master
  $ heroku open

At Go Interactive (http://gointeractive.se), we already run several
production web sites exactly like this.

I love my job. <3
