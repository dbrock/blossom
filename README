The purpose of this package is to get you up and running as quickly as
possible with Haml, Sass and Compass.

To use Blossom, simply put this in your config.ru:

  run Blossom(__FILE__)

Now ‘/foo’ maps to ‘foo.haml’ and ‘/foo.css’ to ‘foo.sass’.  The root
maps to ‘index.haml’.

To use ‘foo.haml’ as the root, do this:

  run Blossom(__FILE__, :foo)

Images and other static files go in the ‘static’ directory.

That’s it!

See http://github.com/dbrock/blossom-example for an example
application that uses Bundler and Blossom and runs on Heroku.
